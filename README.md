## Speech Processing Project 
 We worked on Classification of Speech Disorder using Support Vector Machine ( SVMs ) where we designed the features to optimise well with the sparse dataset ( 200 samples ) .  After reading up a lot of researcg papers , we explored various speech based features like jitter , shimmer , Mel Frequency Coeffs (MFCC) & LP Residuals. This work is a joint effort of me and my batchmate Varsha Redla . Our best model accuracy was 95.1 % using XGBoost Algorithm . The entire project was supervised by our TAs and our course instructor .
